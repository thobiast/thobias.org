<a name="RIP">                          ROCKIN' IN THE PARLOUR</a>
     SINGLE: Rockin' In The Parlour/Can I Sit Next To You Girl (1974)
                           Sung by Dave Evans
                        (Young, Young, ??Evans??)

I met her in Caroline
Round about sixty-nine
Well she came up to me and said, "Hi there honey
How'd you like to come along"

CHORUS:
Cause we're gonna have a party
Yeah a rock 'n' roll party
Well we're gonna have a party
And before I knew
We were rockin' in the parlour
Rockin' in the parlour

Well the next time I saw her roll
Was way down in Mexico
She said, "I've got some booze around at my place
So come along and have some fun"

CHORUS



<a name="CISN2YG">                        CAN I SIT NEXT TO YOU GIRL</a>
     SINGLE: Rockin' In The Parlour/Can I Sit Next To You Girl (1974)
                           Sung by Dave Evans
                             (Young, Young)             

I met this girl for the first time on Saturday night
Standing in the queue at the Odeon alright
Then I took her by surprise
When I threw her one of my lines
She started smiling and being real fine
That's when I say-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

Can I sit next to you, girl?

At intermission we were doing alright
Until this guy came up and stood by her side
Then he took ME by surprise
When HE threw her one of my lines
She started smiling at him real fine
That's when he say-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

Can I sit next to you, girl?



<a name="CMH">                              CARRY ME HOME</a>
                   SINGLE: Dog Eat Dog/Carry Me Home (197?)
                          (Young, Young, Scott)

The bartender's working on a late night shift
She's bonka blonds and Bon aims on a midnight drift
And the dance band's playing the same old slam
I'm sinking whiskey and you're sipping fine wine
I don't know what it is you're trying to prove
Well it should be you but it's me who can hardly move
And I've got my reputation lying on the line
Come on baby, be a good dog and help the blind

Won't you carry me home
(Like a truck, pick me up)

You ain't no lady but you've sure got taste in men
That head of yours has got you by time and time again
My arms and legs are aching and my head's about to blow
And your back's been breakin' and I'd hate to spoil the show
But I've just spent next weeks wages and I'm right out of coin
But you want more and it's half past four and they want to close the joint
But we can't afford a taxi, and it's too late for the bus
But I've been told by friends of mine you're someone I can trust

Won't you carry me home
(Don't let me lie here in all this beer)

You drank all your booze and half of mine
I'm bleary eyed and you're waiting for the sunshine (to come and kill me)
Just like the man who threw me on the floor
Don't matter, while I'm down here I might as well try and find the fucking door
Excuse me, have you seen my swizzle stick
And have you got a plastic bag 'cause I'm gonna be sick
I'm dead drunk and heave'n hanging upside down
And you're getting up and leaving, you think I'm gonna drown

Won't you carry me home



<a name="JACKLV">                      THE JACK (Full Live Version)</a>
                      Cleveland 77 (Bootleg) (1977)
                          (Young, Young, Scott)

Here's a song of the record High Voltage
This one is a song about the clap
Now we call it `She's got the Jack'
We'd like to give this one to you

Psssst
Gonorrhea, oh no, I just had my first dose
Of gonorrhea

She gave me her mind
Then she gave me her body
But it seems to me
That she gave it to anybody
But I made her cry
And I made her scream (scream for me)
[Audience screams]
I took her high
And I curdled her cream
But how was I to know that she had been there before
She told me she was a virgin
She was number nine, ninety-nine on the clinical list
And I fell in love with the dirty little bitch

She's got the Jack
(I hate to tell you this darling)

I searched her mind
And then I searched her body
...But so did everybody
But she gave me her heart
And she gave me her soul
And a great, big - warn out
Empty hole
But how was I to know it had been filled in before
She said, "Bon, I've never had the urgency"
She was number nine, ninety-nine on the critical list
And I fell in love with the dirty little bitch

She's got the Jack
(I'll kill her)
(Oh and it hurts)

You know, I woke up one morning, and there it was on the sheets - the clap
Now I know you all call it the clap over here so what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna say "She's got the --", and I want you all to shout out 
Just what it is she's got, in this case it's the clap
And if you wanna know who gave it to her, don't look at me

She's got the ...
(I wanna hear your voices)
She's got the ... clap
She's got the ... clap
She's got the ... clap
(That guy down there, whatta you doing?)
She's got the ... clap
(Yeah, you show me)
She's got the ... clap
She's got the ... clap
(She got that too, ha?)
She's got the ... clap

(I think what she needs ... is an Angus Young penicilian)

Angus Young

Alright

She's got the Jack
Oh yes she has

                             (Joe Williams)

Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go down to New Orleans
You know I love you so
Baby please don't go

When the man done gone

When the man done gone down the county farm
He got the shackles on
Baby please don't go
Don't leave me

I'll be a dog 
I'll be a dog 
I'll be a dog kiss your way down here
When you walk along
Baby please don't go

Why must you leave me
Lying on my back
Going across the other side of the track
Found yourself a new man I know
So baby please don't go
Baby please don't go

Oh please, please don't leave me
I don't want to be left alone baby
Oh don't go, don't go, don't go

To make a man outta me

CHORUS:

CHORUS

And she's got taste my lady

                          (Young, Young, Scott)

Saw you in the front row
Moving to the beat
(Just movin' and groovin')
Killed me when I saw
The wet patch on your seat
(Wasn't Coca Cola)
Oh baby
I hope you liked the show
When the band said good night
I had to say hello

CHORUS:
Little lover, I can't get you off my mind (no)
Little lover, I've been trying hard to find
Someone like you

Oh baby
You sure looked sweet
(Cruisin')
A leg either side
Of my motorcycle seat
(Just oozin')
Could have been a nightmare
Could have been a dream
But on my way home, baby
I thought I heard you scream

Little lover, I can't get you off my mind 
Little Lover, I've been trying hard to find
someone to give me the things that I need, ow!

You had my picture
On your bedroom wall
(Next to Gary Glitter)
I was standing on the stage
Playing rock 'n' roll
(I was a guitar picker)
Never had a record
Never had a hit
Oh baby
You didn't mind a bit

CHORUS

Baby I know you're a -

                         (Young, Young, Scott)

You've been smiling lately baby
You've been singing in the bath
You've been acting like a lady
Not a dirty photograph
Then tonight you came home early
Packed a bag or two
It's been worrying me honey
Just what you're gonna do

Stick around, yeah, stick around
Stick around, babe, stick around

Well you came on like a hurricane
About a month ago
Blowing like a stiff breeze
Always on the go
All the good times that we had
All stayed in the past
All the good lays that I get
Never seem to last

Stick around, yeah, stick around
Stick around, babe, stick around
(Come on baby, sit on this)

What have I been doing lately
To make you wanna go
I take you out dancing
Honey we can go out to a show
Spend a night romancing
Nights out on the town
Listen to me baby
You'll be glad you stopped around

Stick around, yeah, stick around
Stick around, babe, stick around

                             (Young, Young)

Well, I met her in the garden
Underneath that old apple tree
Sitting with a handful of flowers
Looking as cool as can be
We talked away a couple of hours
Then she laid her hand on my lap
Oh, I thought I got to be dreaming
I didn't know I fell in her trap

CHORUS:
Then she made me say things I didn't want to say
Then she made me play games I didn't want to play
She was a soul stripper, she took my heart
Soul stripper, and tore me apart

She started moving nice and easy
Slowly getting into my spine
Killing off this nice little feeling
Ooooh, everyone she could find
And when she had me hollow and naked
That's when she put me down
Pulled out a knife and flashed it before me
Stuck it in and turned it around

CHORUS

                          (Young, Young, Scott)

You can roll me round your finger
You can roll me if I'm blind
You can roll me tally ho ho
I'm easy rollin' kind
But don't think I'm facin' down hill
'Cause soon you'll see
You'll lose your grip and slip
'Cause you ain't got a hold on me

CHORUS:
You ain't got a hold on me
You ain't got a hold on me
Why don't you let me free
'Cause you ain't got a hold on me

You can take me to your bedroom
You can take me to your heart
You can take me to a climax
I won't fall apart
But don't count on me givin' it
All back to you
Just because I'm hooked on livin
Doesn't mean I'm hooked on you

                          (Young, Young, Scott)

I can tell by the look in your eye
I can tell by the way you sigh
That you know I've been thinking of you
And you know what I want to do

Oh Jean

When you smile I see stars in the sky
When you smile I see sunrise
And I know you've been thinking of me
And I know how you want it to be

Oh Jean

I can tell by the things you say
I can tell that you know the way
And I know what you want me to do
Oh, I've got hearts and flowers for you

If you leave me you'll make me cry
When I think of you saying good bye
Oh the sky turns to a deeper blue
That's - that's how I'd feel if I lost you

Oh Jean

You learn to sing
You learn to play
Why don't the businessman 
Ever learn to pay

CHORUS:
That's show business
Show bizness
Show bizness
That's the way it goes

You play in halls 
You play in bars
You're climbin' walls
Chasin' stars

CHORUS

You pay the men
You pay your dues
When it's all gone
You sing the blues

CHORUS

You wanna roll
You wanna rock
But you find it hard
If your guitar's in hock

CHORUS

We smoke our butts
They smoke cigars
We drown in debt
They drown in bars

CHORUS

You pull a chick
Take her home
No use, man
You're worn out to the bone

Ridin' down the highway
Goin' to a show
Stop in all the by-ways
Playin' rock 'n' roll
Gettin' robbed
Gettin' stoned
Gettin' beat up
Broken boned
Gettin' had
Gettin' took
I tell you folks
It's harder than it looks

It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
If you think it's easy doin' one night stands
Try playin' in a rock roll band
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll

Hotel, motel
Make you wanna cry
Lady do the hard sell
Know the reason why
Gettin' old
Gettin' grey
Gettin' ripped off
Under-paid
Gettin' sold
Second hand
That's how it goes
Playin' in a band

It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
If you wanna be a star of stage and screen
Look out it's rough and mean
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top
If you wanna rock 'n' roll
Well, it's a long way
It's a long way, (they tell me)
It's a long way, such a long way

My Daddy was workin' nine to five
When my Momma was havin' me
By the time I was half alive
I knew what I was gonna be
I left school and grew my hair
They didn't understand
They wanted me to be respected as
A doctor or a lawyer man
(But I had other plans)

Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll, 
A rock 'n' roll star

Well I worked real hard and bought myself
A rock 'n' roll guitar
I gotta be on top some day
I wanna be a star
I can see my name in lights
And I can see the queue
I got the devil in my blood
Tellin' me what to do
(And I'm all ears)

Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll,
a rock 'n' roll star
(I hear it pays well)

Well you can stick your nine to five livin'
And your collar and your tie
And stick your moral standards
'Cause it's all a dirty lie
You can stick your golden handshake
And you can stick your silly rules
And all the other shit
That they teach to kids in school
('Cause I ain't no fool)

Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll,
A rock 'n' roll star 
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll,
A rock 'n' roll star.
Yes I are!

She gave me the Queen
She gave me the King
She was wheelin' and dealin'
Just doin' her thing
She was holdin' a pair
But I had to try
Her Deuce was wild
But my Ace was high
But how was I to know
That she'd been dealt with before
Said she'd never had a Full House
But I should have known
From the tattoo on her left leg
And the garter on her right
She'd have the card to bring me down
If she played it right

She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack
She's got the Jack

Poker face was her name
Poker face was her nature
Poker straight was her game
If she knew she could get you
She play'd 'em fast
And she play'd 'em hard
She could close her eyes
And feel every card
But how was I to know
That she'd been shuffled before
Said she'd never had a Royal Flush
But I should have known
That all the cards were comin'
From the bottom of the pack
And if I'd known what she was dealin' out
I'd have dealt it back

She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack, And who knows what else?
She's got the Jack, yeah, yeah
She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack
She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack, Ooh, was a bad deal, Jack
She gave me the Jack hey
She's got the Jack, She's got the Jack, She's got the Jack
Ooh, can't ya tell? 
She's got the Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack
She's got the Jack, She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack, She's got the Jack
You Never know! She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack, She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack, and it hurts!
She's got the Jack
She's got the Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack
She's got the Jack
AAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Oooooh! 
Thank you, thank you, Thank you people, Thank you, Thank you
I'm glad you like the show, yes, thank you very much folks.
Good night and God bless!

I met this girl for the first time on Saturday night
Standing in the queue at the Odeon alright
Oh I took her by surprise
When I gave her one of my lines
She started smiling at me real fine (ha ha)
That's when I said

Can I sit next to you, girl
Can I sit next to you, girl
Can I sit next to you, girl
Can I sit next to you, girl
Can I sit next to you?

At intermission we were doing alright
Until this guy came up and stood by her side
Oh I took him by surprise
When I gave him one of my lines
She started smiling at me real fine
And that's when I said

Can I sit next to you, girl
Can I sit next to you, girl
Can I sit next to you, girl
Can I sit next to you, girl
Can I sit next to you

Up in the morning and out to school
The teacher is teaching the golden rule
American history and practical maths
[You] Studyin' hard and hoping to pass
Working your fingers right down to the bone
And the guy behind you won't leave you alone

Ring ring goes the bell
The cook in the lunch room is ready to sell       [kitchen's ready to sell]
[But] You're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you have time to eat
[Well] Back in the classroom open your books
Gee but the teacher don't know how mean she looks

Hail hail rock 'n' roll

[As] Soon as 3 o'clock rolls aroun'
You finally lay your burden down
Throw down your books and out of your seat
You go down the hallway, into the street
And you're tryin' to forget just where you've been 
You find a juke joint, you go in

Drop the quarter into the slot
You gotta hear something that's really hot
With the one you love you're makin' romance
All day long you've been wanting to dance
Feeling the music from head to toe
Round and round and round you go

Long live rock 'n' roll

Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll

The following is a true story
Only the names have been changed 
To protect the guilty -

Well I left my job in my home town
And I headed for the smoke
Got a rock 'n' roll band and a fast right hand
Gonna get to the top
Nothing's gonna stop us, no nothing

So if you've got the money, we've got the sound
You put it up and we'll put it down
If you got the dollar, we got the song
Just wanna boogie woogie all night long
Yeh boogie

I got holes in my shoes
I got holes in my teeth
I got holes in my socks
I can't get no sleep
I'm trying to make a million

And I got patches on the patches
On my old blue jeans
Well they used to be blue
When they used to be new
When they used to be clean 

But I've got a Momma whose a hummer      [and I've got a mama, whose a hummer]
Whose keeping me alive                   [[just] keepin' me alive]
While I'm in the band doing drinking with the boys [while I'm doin' drinkin 
She's working 9 to 5                                with the boys]
[She] knows her place that woman

Just you wait -
One of these days see me driving round town
In my rock 'n' Rolls Royce with the sun roof down
My bottle of booze
No summer time blues
Shouting out, "Look at me"
In my rock 'n' roll voice

Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
repeat

"Hey hello Howard, how you doin', my next door neighbour?"
"Oh yea... Get your fuckin' jumbo jet off my airport"

           SINGLE: Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap/Big Balls-The Jack 
                          (Young, Young, Scott)

I'm [ever | rather] upper class high society
God's gift to ballroom notoriety
I always fill my ballroom
The event is never small
The social pages say I've got
The biggest balls of all

CHORUS:
I've got big balls
I've got big balls
And they're such big balls
Dirty big balls
And he's got big balls
And she's got big balls
But we've got the biggest balls of them all

And my balls are always bouncing
My ballroom always full
And everybody cums and cums again
If your name is on the guest list
No one can take you higher
Everybody says I've got
Great balls of fire

CHORUS

Some balls are held for charity
And some for fancy dress
But when they're held for pleasure
They're the balls that I like best
My balls are always bouncing
To the left and to the right
It's my belief that my big balls
Should be held every night

CHORUS

And I'm just itching to tell you about them
Oh we had such wonderful fun
Seafood cocktail, crabs, crayfish...

Ball sucker

It's another lonely evening 
And another lonely town
But I ain't too young to worry 
And I ain't too old to cry
When a woman gets me down
Got another empty bottle 
And another empty bed
Ain't too young to admit it 
And I'm not too old to lie
I'm just another empty head

That's why I'm lonely
I'm so lonely
But I know what I'm gonna do -

I'm gonna ride on
Ride on
Ride on, standing on the edge of the road
Ride on, thumb in the air
Ride on, one of these days I'm gonna
Ride on, change my evil ways
Till then I'll just keep ridin' on

Broke another promise
And I broke another heart
But I ain't too young to realize
That I ain't too old to try
Try to get back to the start
And it's another red light nightmare
Another red light street
And I ain't too old to hurry
Cause I ain't too old to die
But I sure am hard to beat

But I'm lonely
Lord I'm lonely
What am I gonna do -

Ride on
Ride on, got myself a one-way ticket
Ride on
Ride on, going the wrong way
Ride on, gonna change my evil ways
Ride on, one of these days
One of these days

Ride on
Ride on
I'm gonna ride on
Ride on, looking for a truck
Ride on
Ride on, keep on riding
Riding on and on and on

There was a friend of mine on murder
And the judge's gavel fell
Jury found him guilty
Gave him sixteen years in hell
He said "I ain't spending my life here
I ain't living alone
Ain't breaking no rocks on the chain gang
I'm breakin' out and headin' home

Gonna make a jailbreak
And I'm lookin' towards the sky
I'm gonna make a jailbreak
Oh, how I wish that I could fly

All in the name of liberty
All in the name of liberty
Got to be free

Jailbreak, let me out of here
Jailbreak, sixteen years
Jailbreak, had more than I can take
Jailbreak, yeah"

He said he'd seen his lady being fooled with
By another man
She was down and he was up
He had a gun in his hand
Bullets started flying everywhere
And people started to scream
Big man lying on the ground
With a hole in his body
Where his life had been
But it was -

All in the name of liberty
All in the name of liberty
I got to be free

Jailbreak, jailbreak
I got to break out
Out of here

Heartbeats they were racin'
Freedom he was chasin'
Spotlights, sirens, rifles firing
But he made it out
With a bullet in his back

You never told me where you came from
You never told me your name
I didn't know if you were legal tender
But I spent you just the same
I didn't think it could happen to me
But I fell in love in the first degree -

It was love at first feel            
(I was touched with too much)

They told me it was disgustin'
They told me it was a sin
They saw me knocking on your front door
And they saw me smile when you let me in
You and me baby we're all alone
Let's get something goin'
While your mum and dad ain't home -

It was love at first feel

Don't stop drinking whiskey baby since you been gone
Ain't no one I know do it as good as you
Licking on that licking stick the way you do
You got the lips to make a strong man weak and a heathen pray
Givin' you the jump it ain't the way you speak, Lord it's just the way

Go down

Mary, Mary, you're the one for me
And the way you hum, sting like a bumble bee bzzzz
I'll be around to see you about, about half past ten
Ain't felt this good since I don't know when
You got the touch that I need so much in your finger tips
I got honey what you love to taste on those lovely lips

So go down

Oh baby, rub it on
It's still as sweet, 			[yeah it's sticky and sweet,]
It's been so long			[and it's been so long]
And no else got a touch like you	[ain't no one else...]
I let you do the things to me 		[I'll let you do little things to me]
that no other women do			
It feels good, it feels good, oh yeah
Girl you do it like you should (?)

I loved it so much
You make a ??? of a man        (You make me glad I'm a man)

Up's above and down's below 
And limbo's inbetween
Up you win, down you lose
It's anybody's game

And it's a eye for eye
Tooth for tooth
It's a lie

See a blind man on the street 
Looking for something free
Hear the kind man ask his friends
"Hey, what's in it for me?"

In the beginning
Back in nineteen fifty-five
Man didn't know about a rock 'n' roll show
And all that jive
The white man had the smoltz
The black man had the blues
No one knew what they was gonna do
But Tchaikovsky had the news
He said -

"Let there be sound", and there was sound
"Let there be light", and there was light
"Let there be drums", and there was drums
"Let there be guitar", and there was guitar
"Let there be rock"

And it came to pass
That rock 'n' roll was born
All across the land every rockin' band
Was blowing up a storm
The guitarman got famous
The businessman got rich
And in every bar there was a super star
With a seven year itch
There were fifteen million fingers
Learning how to play
And you could hear the fingers picking
And this is what they had to say

"Let there be light"
"Sound"
"Drums"
"Guitar"
"Let there be rock"

One night in a club called `The Shaking Hand'
There was a ninety-two decibel rocking band
The music was good and the music was loud
And the singer turned and he said to the crowd -

"Let there be rock"

On the day I was born the rain fell down
There was trouble brewing in my home town
It was the seventh day, I was the seventh son
And it scared the hell out of everyone

They said stop, I said go
They said fast, I said slow
They said yes, I said no
I do the bad boy boogie

Being a bad boy ain't that bad
I've had me more dirty women than most men ever had
All you women come along with me
And I'll show you how good a bad boy can be

I said right and they said left
I said east and they said west
I said up and they said down
I do the bad boy boogie all over town

I wanna tell you no story, tell you no lie
I was born to love till the day I die
I just line them up and I knock them down
And they all came running when the word got round
(Just keep a running)

I said up, they said down
They said straight, I said round
They said lost, I said found
I said free and they said bound
Bad boy boogie

I never smoked with no cigarettes
I never drank much booze
But I'm only a man, don't you understand
And a man can sometimes lose
You gave me something I never had
Pulled me down with you
Pulled me up, think I'm in love
Hope you can pull me through

CHORUS:
I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy but it's true
Ain't nothing I can do
I overdosed on you

Oh woman you give to me
More than I can take
But listen honey, I don't mind
You're a habit I don't want to break
Don't want none of that hard stuff
Don't need it anymore
I'm in love, and I'm sinking fast
And I don't need no cure

Gee I was happy as a man could be
To far gone to escape
Power of love, don't pull me off
Just write on my grave:

Well they moved on down 
And they crawled around
Walking sideways
Sideway walking
Give me the blues

And you start to scratch 
When they start to hatch
Walking sideways
Sideway walking
Give me the blues

But when they start to bite 
Then it's time you set alight
For an appointment
Before you start to scream 
That's when you apply the cream
Blues ointment

Well the doctor said
"We got to make our beds"           [We got to make 'em dead]
Walking sideways
Sideway walking
Give me the blues

And when you start to scream
That's when you'll buy the cream
Blues ointment
And when they start to itch
You go out and you take a bitch
For an appointment

Well you rub it on
And you rub it in
Stops them walking
Sideway walking
Gives them the blues

Hey you -

Sometimes I think this woman is kinda hot
Sometimes I think this woman is sometimes not
Puts me down, fools me around
What's she doing to me?
Out for satisfaction, any piece of action
That ain't the way it should be
She needs love, smells out a man
She's gotta see
Pours my beer, licks my ear
Brings out the devil in me

Hell ain't a bad place to be

Spends my money, drinks my booze, stays out every night
And I got to thinking, "Hey, just a minute, something ain't right"
Disillusions and confusion
Make me want to cry
All the same, you lead your games
Tellin' me your lies
Don't mind her playing a demon
As long as it's with me
If this is hell then you could say
It's heavenly

Hell ain't a bad place to be

Late at night turns down the lights
Closes up on me
Opens my heart, tears it apart
Brings out the devil in me

Hell ain't no bad place to be

'Bout a woman I know

Oh she steals the show
She ain't exactly pretty
Ain't exactly small
Forty-two, thirty-nine, fifty-six
You could say she's got it all

Never had a woman
Never had a woman like you
Doing all the things
Doing all the things you do
Ain't no fairy story
Ain't no skin and bone
But you give it all you got
Weighing in at nineteen stone

CHORUS:
You're a whole lotta woman
A whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
And you're a whole lotta woman

Oh honey you can do it
Do it to me all night long
Only one to turn
Only one to turn me on
All through the night time
And right around the clock
To my surprise
Rosie never stops

Packed her heart in a travelling bag    [Fought so hard in a travelin' band]
And never said bye bye
Somethings missing in the neighbourhood

Do a favourite tune                     [to her favourite jewel]

Wrap yourself around
Like a second skin
Packed her favourite bag                [packed|picked her favourite nag]

I took your number in another town
She took another pill
She was runnin' in overdrive

She never made it past the bedroom door
What was she aiming for?                [why I'd thought she'd even pour]

Gone shootin'
My baby's gone shootin'

Gone Shootin'
I thought that she wouldn't even know
Gone Shootin
hey look out, look out, look out, look out!

She's shootin heroin!

Gone shootin
She's shootin loaded
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone, she's gone
Gone shootin

I used to love her so

See it on the television every day
Hear it on the radio
It ain't humid but it sure is hot
Down in Mexico
The boy is trying to tell me
Near enough to the edge   (beginning of the end)
Say they've all been there
Too late my friend

Riff raff
Always good for a laugh (ha ha ha)
Riff raff
Go on, laugh yourself in half

(Smile awhile)

Now I'm the kind of guy who keeps his big mouth shut
Don't bother me
Somebody give me one arm up
Leave me in misery
I've never shot nobody
Don't even carry a gun
I ain't done nothing wrong
I'm just having fun

Riff raff
Always good for a laugh 
Riff raff
Go on, laugh yourself in half

do it again

Deep inside of me
It's yearning
But I'm going to set it free

I'm going in to sin city
I'm gonna win in sin city
Where the lights are bright
Do the town tonight
I'm gonna win in sin city

Ladders and snakes
Ladders give, snakes take
Rich man, poor man, beggarman, thief
Ain't got a hope in hell, that's my belief

Fingers Freddy, Diamond Jim
They're getting ready, 			[Better get ready,]
look out I'm coming in	 		['coz I'm coming in]
So spin that wheel, cut that [pack | deck]  
And roll those loaded dice
Bring on the dancing girls
And put the champaigne on ice

Well I've been up to my neck in trouble
Up to my neck in strife
Up to my neck in misery
For most of my life 
I've been a fool
And you know what a fool can do 
I'm telling you
You came along when I needed you
Now I'm up, I'm up to my neck in you

And I've been up to my neck in pleasure
Up to my neck in pain
I've been up to my neck on the railroad track
Waitin' for the train 
To cruise on through
Well baby my time is due
Oh it's way overdue
You came along and you pulled me through
Now I'm up, up, up to my neck in you

and don't it feel good

Well I've been up to my neck in whiskey
I've been up to my neck in wine
I've been up to my neck in wishing 
That this neck wasn't mine 
I was a loser
You weren't lost
Baby you were too good, too good to be true
What you've got no one else could do
Now I'm up, I'm up to my neck in you

Well I tied my baby to the railroad track
Cannonball down the line
Giving that woman just a one more chance
To give it to me one more time
Engineer wishing he was home in bed
Dreaming about Casey Jones
Wide-eyed woman heading a mile ahead		[...woman half a mile ahead]
Thinking about broken bones

CHORUS:
It's her love that I want
It's her love that I need
It's her love got to have
It's her love

Heavenly body flying across the sky
Superman was out of town
Come on honey, gotta change your tune
Cause it's a long way down
Clark Kent looking for a free ride
Thinking about Lois Lane
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's - a suicide
And that'd be a shame

CHORUS

But what's next to the moon?

Long Arm looking for a fingerprint
Trying to find the mystery clue
Hitting me with the third degree
Working on a thumb screw 
Alright, officer, I confess
Everything's coming back
I didn't mean to hurt that woman of mine
It was a heart attack

It's her love that I want
It's her love that I need
It's her love got to have
It's her love guaranteed

the love that I want
it's your love that I need
it's your love got to have

Two faced woman with the two faced lies
I hope your two faced living made you satisfied
Tell me baby I was your only one
While you've been running around town with every mother's son

Told your story about the women like you
Told your story about the things you do
I used to think that you were sugar and spice
I should've listened to my mother's advice

Kicked in the teeth again
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
Kicked in the teeth again
Ain't this misery ever gonna end?
And I've been kicked in the teeth
Kicked in the teeth again

Two faced woman, such a crying shame
Don't know nothing, you're all the same
You run around, hope you had your fun
You never know who's gonna win till the race been run

Kicked in the teeth again
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
Kicked in the teeth again
Ain't this misery ever gonna end?
I've been kicked in the teeth
Kicked in the teeth
Kicked in the teeth again

Cold hearted man
One time lover heart in his hand
Cold hearted man
And you can't trust nothing you don't understand

Hurt his pride
Deep inside
He was another mother's son
Reputation
Broken glass
Everybody prayed 
For their lives on the street
Where they happened to meet

CHORUS

Sometimes you can't see
The other side
It's too well hidden
For the naked eye
One time lover
With his heart in his hand
Two time loser
A broken man

I've been around the world
I've seen a million girls
Ain't one of them got
What my lady she's got
She steals the spotlight
Knocks me off my feet
She's enough to start a landslide
Just a walkin' down the street
Wearing dresses so tight
And looking dynamite
Enough to blow me out
No doubt about it can't live without it

CHORUS:
The girl's got rhythm (girl's got rhythm)

Too much for any man
She gives me first degree
She really satisfies me
Love me till I'm legless
Aching and sore
Enough to stop a freight train
Or start the Third World War
You know I'm losin' sleep
I'm in too deep
Like a body needs blood
No doubt about it can't live without it

You know she moves like sin
And when she lets me in
It's like liquid love   
No doubt about it can't live without it

Ain't no woman in the world I know
'Cause I ain't looking for (an overflow?)
Oh baby I ain't got much
Resistance to your touch
Take off the high heels, let down your hair
Paradise ain't far from there

I wanna walk all over you
I wanna walk all over you
Do anything you want me to, baby
I wanna walk all over you

Reflections on the bedroom wall
And there you thought you'd see it all
We're rising, falling like the sea
You're looking so good under me

I'm gonna walk all over you
I'm gonna walk all over you
Do anything you want me to do to you
I'm gonna walk all over you

(Roaming, roaming, stayin' alive)(?)
So give me the stage, I'm gonna steal the show

It was one of those nights
When you turned out the lights
And everything comes into view
She was taking her time
I was losing my mind
There was nothing that she wouldn't do
It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
She knew we was making love
I was so satisfied
Deep down inside
Like a hand in a velvet glove

CHORUS:
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This kind of woman's gonna drive me insane
She's got a touch, a touch too much

She had the face of an angel
Smiling with sin
A body of Venus with arms
Dealing with danger
Stroking my skin
Let the thunder and lightening start
It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
It wasn't that she didn't care
She wanted it hard
And wanted it fast
She liked it done medium rare

CHORUS

Seems like a touch, touch too much
You know it's much too much, much too much
I really want to feel your touch too much
Girl you know you're getting me much too much
Seems like a touch
Just a dirty little touch
I really need your touch
Cause you're much too much too much

Smiling face and [loving | laughing] eyes
But you keep on telling me all those lies
How do you expect me to believe
Honey I ain't that naive
Baby I got my eye on you
[But | cause] you do all the things that I want you to
Stop your crying and dry your tears
I ain't that wet behind the ears

You can throw me left
And you can throw me right
but where was you last night
Beating around the bush

Wish I knew what's on your mind
Why you're being so unkind?
Remember those nights you spent alone  [...nights of stayin' alone]
Talking on the telephone?
Thoughts of you go through my brain
You told me that you felt the same
You told me that you love me too (?) 
Tell me who would lie with you? 

I was talking birds			   [I was talking about birds]
And you was talking bees		   [And you was talking about bees]
Was he was down upon his knees
Beating around the bush

You're the meanest woman I've ever known
Sticks and stones won't break my bones
I know what you're looking for
You ate your cake, you want some more
I'm gonna give you just a one more chance
Try to save our romance
Done everything I'm gonna do		   [That's all I'm gonna do]
The rest is up to you

You can chew it up
And you can spit it out
Let it all hang out
Beating around the bush

Oh.
Chew it up
Spit it out
Let it all hang out
Beating around the bush

Till it's hanging out your back

I'm your Night Prowler, get out of my way
Look out for the Night Prowler, watch you tonight
I'm the Night Prowler, when you turn out the light ...

Too scared to turn your light out
'Cos there's something on your mind
Was that a noise outside your window?
What's that shadow on the blind?
As you lie there naked
Like a body in a tomb
Suspended animation
As I slip into your room

Looking at your beat on the street
You're always pushing, shoving
Satisfied with nothing

All your digging for gold
You make me wonder
Yes I wonder, I wonder

Honey, whaddya do for money?
Where you get your kicks?

You're loving on the take
And you're always on the make
Squeezing all the blood out of men
They're all standing in a queue
Just to spend the night with you
It's business as usual again
You're always grabbin', stabbin'
Trying to get it back in
But girl you must be getting slow

She was a fast machine
She kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman I had ever seen  [...that I, ever seen]
She had the sightless eyes
Telling me no lies				   [telling me my own line]
Knockin' me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share
Had me fighting for air
She told me to come but I was already there

'Cause the walls start shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it and you -

CHORUS:
Shook me all night long
Yeah you shook me all night long

Working double time
On the seduction line
She was one of a kind, she's just mine all mine
She wanted no applause                      [Taking no applause]
Just another course
Made a meal out of me and came back for more
Had to cool me down
To take another round
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing

'Cause the walls were shaking
The earth was quaking
My mind was aching
And we were making it and you -

CHORUS

And knocked me out and then you
Shook me all night long
You had me shakin' and you
Shook me all night long
Yeah you shook me
Well you took me

You reall took me and you
Shook me all night long
Ooooh you
Shook me all night long
Yeah, yeah, you
Shook me all night long

Your really took me and you
Yeah you shook me, yeah you shook me

CHORUS:
C.O.D. - care of the devil
C.O.D. - the devil in me
C.O.D. - care of the devil
Care of the devil in me

The curse of love is the cause of the pain
The crime of the day is when you do it again
Call of the doctor, cash on demand
If you give them a finger, they'll take off your hand

CHORUS
(Down to the devil with me)

Call of a dog, cry of a bitch
The sign of the sinner is the size of his itch

CHORUS

I'm paying, paying, I'm paying C.O.D.
Care of the devil, care of the devil in me
It's the curse of love

Black sheep and a renegade
Hot feet in the cool of the shade
Street shuffle and a tough childhoods
Examinations done no good
Crow bars and a hot wired cars
Sneak thieves and cheap cigars
No rebellion, not today
I get my kicks in my own way
Right, OK

Just keep on breaking the rules
Come on, get ready to rule

Tough breaks in the neighbourhood
A hard case who's up to no good
Living like trash, a society rash
Ready to break, and ready to dash
A bad deal and a real rough ride
You're doing time on the other side
No rebellion, not today
I get my kicks in my own way
Right, OK

Just keep on breaking the rules
Come on, get ready to rule

(Tough breaks)

They got regulation ties
Regulation shoes
Those regulation fools
With their regulation rules

Just keep on breaking the rules
Come on, get ready to rule

Oh take off your ties and your regulation shoes
You're nothing but a bunch of regulation fools
And you got your regulation rules  
I'm going to do things my own way
Every day and every way

Who's your leader, who's your man?
Who will help you fill your hand?
Who's your friend and who's your foe?
Who's your Judas, you don't know?

Night of the long knives

Where's that saviour, where's that light
When you're praying for your life?
Who's that fighting back to back?
Who's defending whose attack?

Night of the long knives

Blinded by a bright beam 
Shattered by the windscreen
Stunned by the whiplash 
I'm a victim of a bad crash
I can do nothing right 
I never sleep at night
Can't even start a fight
My feet have left the ground
Spinning round and round

Spellbound, my world keeps a tumbling down

Beaten by a blind bend 
Wrong way up a dead end
Screaming through a speed trap 
As I tear into a tail back
I can do nothing right
I never sleep at night
Can't even start a fight
My feet have left the ground
Spinning round and round

Spellbound, my world keeps a tumbling down

I'm slipping down
I got my hands in the fire

I'm sliding on an oil slick
Blinded on a bad trip
Yes and nothing's going to change it
I can do nothing right
Can't even sleep at night
My feet have left the ground
I'm spinning round and round

Spellbound, my world keeps a tumbling down

Dog day, it's Tuesday 
Hope that girl she'll come today
Hard life, it's a city life
Sweat keep pourin' down
I got my feet up, like to love 
Through the dawn till I've blown
All I want's her lovin' now
I love the way she move around

Need no excuse 
To let it all hang loose
My body's for abuse

Rising power, we'll raise the night
Rising power
Rising power, we'll wake the dead
Rising power

Love life, up all night
Darkest hour at the dead of night
Seen her walkin' down the street
The kind of woman that brings on heat
Love her dusk till dawn 
Come the morning, she was gone
Took me all to my surprise
Money gone, left high and dry

Need no excuse 
To let it all hang loose

The blood in my veins
Was running right through my brain
There was a cop with a gun
Who was running around insane
Three fifty arrests
No bullet proof vest
Now ain't that a shame
We wanted to play
Play for the crowd
"No", said the wankers
"You're on your way out"

Bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium

The place was a jumpin'
And the booze was going down
There's a curfew in town
You've been working overtime
We don't play just for pay
So we'd like to stay
Stay just the same
He gave me a crack
In the back with his gun
I bled so bad
I could feel the blood run

Bedlam in Belgium 
It was bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium
Came for a good time
Left on the run.
Bedlam in Belgium 
Who's to blame, it's a shame

Bedlam in Belgium
It was bedlam
You gonna run out

Stage was stage
Cops enraged
Crying for more
It was war, war, war

Bedlam in Belgium
Came for a good time
Left on the run.

                         (Young, Young, Johnson)

Highball women that are hot to touch
Legs do the talkin' spellin' out lust
See the Sugar Daddies with a sweet tooth and a smile
See what's hangin' off him like a want'n child
That's where you'll find me standing proud

CHORUS:
Playing with girls gonna get you hot
Playing with guns gonna get you shot
Playing with fire gonna heat you up
Playing with me you're gonna get the lot

Bring on the showgirls and the debutantes
Late-night waitress in a restaurant
Headin' for the clubs and bars with the flashin' lights
Lookin' for the good-time girls in their black nylon tights
Over the barrel bottoms-up

REPEAT CHORUS

Oooh river run dry
Yeah playing with fire
Oooh wild sweet child
Playing with girls
Playing with girls

I like a tall girl, but I'll take 'em small
I want 'em all up front I like 'em all
I wanna see 'em strut their stuff
Lose their social grace
You play your cards right and you'll deal yourself an ace
That's where you'll find me standing proud

Playing with girls

Put on the headset, get on the stage
Out on a midnight escapade
Didn't want to steal your thunder
Wouldn't want to play your game
Makin' all the headlines
Gettin' on the front page
Didn't even know her number
I didn't even know her name

CHORUS:
Stand up, stand up and take it
Stand up, stand up and make it
Stand up, stand up and face it
Stand up

Get on the red dress, slip on the lace
Up for a high heel and a pretty face
Woman wanna get you under
Woman wanna get you tame
Lovin' on a hot night
Stokin' up the flame
Didn't wanna know her number
I didn't wanna know her name

Everybody, you don't have to choose
You don't have to prove it

Superstition, black cat in the cradle
Dancing on the table
Don't you snake on me

You know that he (sold? saw?) me

CHORUS:
Come hell or high water
Come hell or high water
Come hell or high water
Come hell or high water

Blood money, lyin' through your back teeth
Fightin' on the main street
Breathe your last breath on me
Mama don' told me

Hot lovin' trigger-happy feelin'
Touchin' up and teasin'
You know it so bad
Mama don' told me
Papa don' scold me, told me, show me, rock 'n' rolled me

Feel the need for one more round
Don't you struggle, don't try to bite
You want some trouble, I'm the king of vice
I'm a wreckin' ball, I'm a stingin' knife

Flesh and blood, I'm a rag 'n' bone
Bad luck message on the telephone
Don't you worry, play my game
I'll do you a favor, put your soul for sale
Like a cannon ball, goin' down the track
Need good lovin' but I want it back
I was born in trouble, they gave up on me
Teacher preachin' what not to be

The video game says "Play me"
Face it on a level but it takes you every time on a one on one
Feeling running down your spine 
Nothing gonna save your one last dime cause it owns you
Through and through

The databank knows my number
Says I gotta pay cause I made the grade last year
Feel it when I turn the screw
Kicks you round the world, there ain't a thing that it can't do
Do to you

CHORUS:
Who made who, who made you?
Who made who, ain't nobody told you?
Who made who, who made you? 
If you made them and they made you 
Who picked up the bill, and who made who?  [or who picked up the glue,...](?)

Who made who, who turned the screw?

Satellites send me picture
Get it in the eye, 
take it to the world   (take it to the wire)
spinning like a dynamo
Feel it going round and round
Running out of chips, you got no line in an 8-bit town
So don't look down, no

CHORUS

Ain't nobody told you, who made who?
Who made you?
Who made who? (who made who)
And who made you? (who made who)
yeah yeah yeah

Nobody told you

(Ooh yeah)
I've been to the left, I've been to the right
I've found myself in Abudhabi, just a mirage in the night
Been to the high, I've been to the low
And I've been to lots of places that I didn't wanna go
But I ain't see nothing to get me off my ass
And I laughed at all the jokers wanna make me walk on glass
I could walk 'fore I could crawl
And I was meaner than a bad dog with his back against the wall

Animal, animal
Cannibal, cannibal
See 'em fall, see 'em fall
I'm the guy that they call -

Meanstreak, I gotta meanstreak
Meanstreak, they call me meanstreak

I just don't know who I wanna be
The count of Monte Cristo or the sheik of Arabia
Eaten rich, and I've eaten free
And I'm the perfect culture vulture in the face of poverty
And I ain't met no one who told me I got class
They say never feed the animal, the boy's got too much flash
I'm a guy they just can't teach
And I always kick the castle that's been built up on the beach (heh ha)

Animal, animal
Cannibal, cannibal
See 'em fall, see 'em fall
Cause I'm the guy that they call -

What's your name?

Meanstreak

I got a meanstreak
Ooh I got a meanstreak
Ooh I got a meanstreak
Wanna feel a meanstreak?
They call me meanstreak
All the children say meanstreak

What's my name?

Meanstreak

Got to have my candy
Got to have my sugar sweet

Giving you directions
You don't have to use your feet

You've got to travel south
South of my hungry mouth
And there you'll find a friend
Until the bitter end

Here she come, here she come
Eating up the thrill
Sugar cane, sugar cane
Dressin' up to kill
Like a fireball in the shadow
Like a storm that's gonna show
Like an overwhelmed volcano
Getting set to blow, set to blow
She got a nasty reputation
She got a healthy apetite
When she needs some detonation
She sets the fuse alight, the fuse alight

Feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite

Let it rain, let it rain
Let me feel it pour
Let it slide, let it slide
Let me feel the core
Like a thunder in the mountains
Like the lightning in the sky
Like the eye of a tornado                       
She watch it all go by, all go by
Then she kills for recreation
And she plays her games at night
She want to work on her vocation
She set the world alight, set world alight

Wrong track, wrong line
First train to run on time
Bad blood, bad news
Long rope, got nothing to lose
Mad bull seeing red
Coming at me, happy when I'm dead
Jump a fence, get away
Ain't got a liking for the games he plays
What you gonna do?

Everybody trying to find you guilty
Make you wanna toe the line
Saved by, saved in the nick of time
I was saved in the nick of time

Slow plane, hard rain
Cold sweat and I feel the strain
Look down, no ground
Black sky, just the engine sound
Bail out, goodbye
Take my chances, I don't wanna die
Count ten, just pray
The nick of time can save me any day
What you gonna do?

Everybody love a hero, honey
Living on a danger line
Saved by, saved in the nick of time
Yeah, saved in the nick of time

Lose sleep, get grief
Some day get no relief
Quick punch, closed eye
You didn't knew it and you wonder why
Lynch mob on your tail
Think they were searching for the holy grail
Leave town, get away
I didn't figure on them anyway
No I didn't today

Everybody trying to find you guilty
Make you wanna toe the line
Saved by, saved in the nick of time
Right in the nick of time
In the nick of time
I was saved in the nick of time

Don't make the news 'til they're doin' time

Three is company

Come on,
Last stand 
Down to my last dime
I ain't got the sense to leave
The dealers cutting fine
Last draw
Back against the wall
Depending where the money is
Is where I'm gonna fall
Ace high
Hide your poker eyes
I didn't want to laugh too much
When I picked up the prize
Lady Luck
Standing at my side
I'll leave with more than I brought in
And I get out with my life
I get out with my life

CHORUS:
I go, you go, she go, we go
Two's up, it's a two's up
Give me head, give me tails
Give me doubled up and coming doubled over on the rails

Give me two's up, it's what I want
(Alright)

High up
When you're looking down
Then you see two animals
Just fooling you around
Stray dogs
Gonna take them in
I don't know what your names are
But you're gonna break them in
All day
It's difficult to say
Who is doing what to whom
Who's out of the play
I love
The way you slide and slip
Love the way you girls work out
And make the partnership
Make that partnership

CHORUS

(Gotta give me double or quits)

Two's up, two's up
Like your partnership
Like the way you slip
There ain't nothing like a two's up
That's the way it is, two's up
It's what I want to hear
Give me head, give me tails
Give me doubled up and coming over on the rails

Two's up, it's locomotion
Two's up, you're drivin' me wild
Give me high, give me low
Give me twice the satisfaction
Twice the pot of gold (?)
And it's a two's up
It's gonna be two's up
We're gonna have a two's up, two's up, two's up, two's up
There ain't nothin' like a two's up

I
I want you
I want you to
I want you to march

Eyes go right, shoulder arms
Left wheel turn, show your charms
Change your clothes, cut your hair
Ain't no joke, ain't no place for kids
When the flags are high, hear the battle cry
Treaty gone, see the bandit fly
Dig that trench, watch the blast
Shell shock come, coming fast

Name and rank on parade
Might get laid by a hand grenade
Do you know what this means?
Do you know what this means?
This - means - war

This means war, this means war

This means war

Cock your gun, wet your sights
Get the bull dead to rights
Volunteers, one pace back
On the beach ain't no place for kids
When the flack is high on a bomber run
You don't talk back to an ack-ack gun
Fire range, and you're in the blitz
Keep your head or you're blown to bits

Name and rank on parade
Might get laid by a hand grenade
Do you know what it means?
Do you know what it means?
This - means - war

Who's going there, is it a friend or foe?
Propaganda time on the radio
Top brass shout as they clown around
Peace talks die in Geneva town

Do you know what it means? (This means war)
Do you know what it means? (This means war)
Do you know what it means? (This means war)
Do you know what it means? (This means)
This - means - war

This means war

                         (Young, Young, Johnson)

You paint a picture
So it's plain to see
Ain't no hiding
No security
I'll be watching
Every move you make
When you hear the rattle
Better be awake

CHORUS:
Snake eyes, I'm watching
Snake eyes, look out
Snake eyes, it's coming
Snake eyes, ain't no escaping from the snake eye
(No way)

You leave a footprint
For my eye to see
Catch an echo
From a lock and key
From the shadow
Or behind a rock
Get you anywhere
From the darkest shack

CHORUS

Hear a rustle
From behind a tree
Get you running
Home to sanctuary
Bolt the door and -
You think you're safe
I'm coming to get you
Gonna reach out (???)

CHORUS

Got the snake eyes, they call me a snake in the bush
Snake eyes, biting
Snake eyes, always watching
Snake eyes

Ain't no escaping from the -
Just keep a lookout for the -
Snake eye

Got the word, getting ready
Gonna get my pay from ????
I'm in light, ????
When the action is hot, ????
No town, no city
Gonna be free from the jumping jack
Kiss of life, getting gritty
If the mule don't kick you know the mule don't ride
And I know, yes I know, well I know
That's the way to go
And I know, and I know
And I know that I'm gonna get it down the road

CHORUS:
Cause I'm living on a borrowed time
Do it your way, I'll do it mine
Living on a borrowed time
Don't need a shove, don't need a sign

Call me names, call me crazy
Don't try to stop me when I feel this way
It's a game, (whoopsy daisy?)
Here comes another girl to make my day
And I know, yes I know, well I know
That's the way to go
And I know, yes I know

She's an idle child, high society
Never pushed a broom, not physically
Her eyes are down on you, her nose is up
Never spill your whiskey when she fill your cup

I'm on the borderline

She can spread them round and she shows them off
With a neon sign saying don't you touch
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
She use me like a begger to get a hold on me

CHORUS:
On the borderline, she's a danger sign
On the borderline, getting out of line
On the borderline, but it feels so good
On the borderline, on the borderline
On the borderline, borderline

(Here goes)

You know I shoot the dice to claim my dream
You pull them in without a thought to me 
She's come to watch you and your pocket is dry (?)
The queen of hearts will kill you when the ace is high

On the borderline

She's an idle child, high society
Never pushed a broom, not physically
Her eyes are down on you, her nose is up
Never spill your whiskey when she fill your cup

CHORUS

Sleazy hotels

With nothing to sell
Want something for nothing
It's always the same
Keep pushing and shoving
And I'm down on the game
Always in trouble
Forever detained

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
And good riddance to bad luck

Well spread out the news
There's a free man loose
Back out of jail
And chasing some flooze
Bad luck has changed
Broken the chains
Lay down a claim
For monetary gains
Wonder what's coming
Out for the take
Freedom for loving
And lust for the taste
Eyes are wide open
Wild to the game

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
And good riddance to bad luck

Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck

The song in question is Loch Lomond, which goes something like the following:
        I'll take the high road
        And you'll take the low road
        And I'll be in Scotland afore ye
        But me and my true love
        Will never meet again
        On the bonny, bonny banks of Loch Lomond

Starring in the coliseum
Tied upon the rack
Up comes the thumb of Caesar
To stab you in the back

Old man's car on a Saturday night
Got me a woman, me I feel alright
Rock and rollin' at the drive-in show
Gonna sit in the back of the passion row
Turn up the soundtrack, turn down the lights
Chance she won't but there's a chance she might
Ain't no woman in the world I know
Ain't had her knickers on the automobile floor

What's that sound?
Thing's goin' down
Look at what's goin' round

Back seat confidential

Said to buy a rubber at the cigarette stand
Dying to get off so that I can get in
Doing my best to make a good connection
She say what you gonna do 'bout my protection?
All right mama, gotta listen to me
Last chance thrill it's half past three
Huggin' and kissin' will be real nice
Every man's got his price

What's that sound?
Thing's goin' down
Look at what's goin' round

Back seat confidential

Got me a woman, me I feel alright
Rock and rollin' at the drive-in show
Gonna sit in the back of the passion row
Turn up the soundtrack, turn down the lights
Chance she won't but there's a chance she might
Ain't no woman in the world I know
Ain't had her knickers in the backseat floor

What's that sound?
Thing's goin' down
Look at what's goin' round

Around!
